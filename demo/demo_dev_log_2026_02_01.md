I want to create a companion data set that can be loaded into the existing schema in a compatible fashion. I want this data set to be called Blue Planet Adventures Outdoor Gear and Apparel. I want it to eventually be complex enough for basic ecommerce testing but the complete data set is out of scope. There will be 5 assortments: Womens, Mens, Kids, Sale and Bouitque will will have the original products that ship with the demo today. I want to have product group to include coats, shirts, pants and footwear i.e. boots and shoes. There are 3 types of winter coats. The coat types are: Hking, Skiing, and Skating. Each has a women's and men's sizing. I want the Women and Men's product to feature the same 5 colors: Black, Whilte, and Pink. The key distinction is the size of the Small, Medium, Large product measurements. I want 2 shirt designs for the the shirts called Wayfinder and Windjammer. Wayfinder features the woods, and Windjammer features a lake scene. details to be added later. Each shirt comes in 3 colors, Black, White and Pink. Each has a separate sizing for women and a separate sizing for men. I want to have 2 foot wear products. Hikers Boots, and Jim Shoes. Both come in womens and mens sizings. Each comes in the colors brown, black and white. Each comes in sizes 1-10. Further details will come if needed. For now just create the data in the same format as the existing data.
